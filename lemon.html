    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 180C/160C fan</li>
        <li>Mix together the butter and caster sugar until creamy consistency is achieved. Add in the eggs one at a time and mix in slowly.</li>
        <li>Sift in the self-raising flour, then add lemon zest and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Grease the muffin tray with a little butter, then spoon the mixture into each case until about 2/3 full.</li>
        <li>Bake for approximately 15 mins or until a skewer inserted comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow it to begin cooling.</li>
        <li>Whilst the cakes are cooling; Gently heat the sugar and lemon juice mixture over the hob until the sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Whilst the cakes are still warm, cut off the central portion of each cupcake (like you would with a butterfly cake) and spoon 1.5 tsp of the syrup into each cupcake. Replace the top of the cake and drizzle the remaining syrup over all of the cupcakes.</li>
        <li>These cupcakes will keep for 3-4 days in an air tight container.</li>
