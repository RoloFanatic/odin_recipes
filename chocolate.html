    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 180C/160C fan</li>
        <li>Mix together all of the cake ingredients in a large mixing bowl EXCEPT for the boiling water.</li>
        <li>Add the boiling water in slowly with mixing until well combined and smooth (the mixture will be very runny).</li>
        <li>Divide the mixture in two and pour into sealed cake tins lined with butter (or grease-proof paper if you are lazy like me).</li>
        <li>Bake for 25-35 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow them to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Whilst the cakes are cooling; Gently heat the cream and chocolate over a water bath until all of the chocolate dissolves. Remove from the heat and allow to cool at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Once the cakes are cooled, and the ganache has thickened to a syrup like consistency (or a little thicker), add a portion to the top of one of the cakes before staking them. Pour the rest of the ganache over the cake and smooth it over the top and sides with a knife.</li>
        <li>This cake must be kept in the fridge due to the ganache coating. Keeps for 4-5 days.</li>
