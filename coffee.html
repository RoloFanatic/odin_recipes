    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-heat oven to 180C/160C fan</li>
        <li>Mix together the butter and caster sugar until creamy consistency is achieved. Add in the eggs one at a time and mix in slowly.</li>
        <li>Sift in the self-raising flour, then add espresso shots and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Finally, add in the walnuts.</li>
        <li>Grease the muffin tray with a little butter, then spoon the mixture into each case until about 2/3 full.</li>
        <li>Bake for approximately 15 mins or until a skewer inserted comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and allow it to cool.</li>
        <li>After the cakes have cooled, prepare the buttercream icing; mix together the butter and icing sugar until fully combined. Add in the coffee shots (more can be added if you prefer). If the mixture goes too thin, just add some more icing sugar.</li>
        <li>After the cakes have cooled completely; pipe the buttercream icing onto the cupcakes.</li>
        <li>These cupcakes will keep for 3-4 days in an air tight container.</li>
